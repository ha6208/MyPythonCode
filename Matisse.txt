The Red Room, a painting by Henri Matisse, consists of strong modernist concepts. 
The amount of red that appears in the painting creates a setting that both fragments and fuses different aspects of the scene. 
A desire is shown in the painting as well, through the constant appearance of doubles, such as the fruit, wine, and chairs. 
The food and drink on the table are suggestive of fragmentation because of their haphazard organization. All these things combine to create a strongly modernist painting.
The rooms overwhelming amount of red fuses the wallpaper and the tablecloth into one. 
This serves to make all other objects inside of the red appear fragmented, a common concept in modernist art. 
This is also reminiscent of dreaming as it has condensed the wall and table, creating a void like space. The woman at the end of the table has her eyes closed, suggestive that she is in fact asleep, and she appears to be in this red space as if drifting or floating in a dream. 
Her features are also very calm, as though resting. The amount of food on the table is also a cause for thought, as the woman is the only one there and how could she eat all of it? 
If she is a maid as she appears to be, due to her dress, then perhaps she is part of the dream and the dreamer dreams of a maid setting a bountiful dinner for him.
